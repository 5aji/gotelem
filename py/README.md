# Pytelem
this is a GUI (using DearPyGui) and a solver helper process (using numpy/scipy).

The GUI is used for clients to connect to the `gotelem` server. The solver code
can be run headless and interface with the gotelem server to use the data from the server
and provide solutions for other clients to ingest.

more to come.
